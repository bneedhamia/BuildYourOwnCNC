# BuildYourOwnCNC
My experience/info building the CNC machine described in the book "Build Your Own CNC Machine" by Patrick Hood-Daniel and James Floyd Kelly.

* BillOfMaterials.ods = parts and tools list I assembled/calculated from the book text. The book doesn't have a parts list.
* diary.odt = my day-to-day diary of the project so far.

State of the project right now:  I've read the book several times, combed over it to create the parts and tools list, have ordered a few parts so I can practice joining parts and building rail bearing assemblies.

Note: the parts list is my best effort, and offers no warranty of correctness or safety.  You are responsible for your own safety and for checking the correctness of the list.
