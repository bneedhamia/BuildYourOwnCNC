# BuildYourOwnCNC
My experience/info building the CNC machine described in the book "Build Your Own CNC Machine" by Patrick Hood-Daniel and James Floyd Kelly.

* BillOfMaterials.ods = parts and tools list I assembled/calculated from the book text. The book doesn't have a parts list.
* diary.odt = my day-to-day diary of the project so far.
* MechanicalNotes.odp = notes on making jigs (which I didn't need because I have a drill press).

State of the project right now:  I've abandoned the project because I found the accuracy requires a table saw, which I don't have and don't want to borrow the use of. I'll reconsider the project if/when I get a table saw.

Note: the parts list is my best effort, and offers no warranty of correctness or safety.  You are responsible for your own safety and for checking the correctness of the list.
